# 42_CPP_modules

This repository contains 9 modules given by the 42 network. 

In every directory the subject is found. You can compile every excercise in the given module by typing
```
make
```
in your comandline.

During the exercises we could not use containers (except for Module 08) since we have to make them ourselves in a future project. However we have to learn crucial cpp knowlegde on for example inheritence, templates, polymorphism & exceptions while writing clean and reliable code.
